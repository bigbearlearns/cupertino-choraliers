The Choraliers started in 1978 as a choral class as part of the “Older Adult Studies” program at De Anza College.  The first director was Joan Lomax.  The class met at the Cupertino Senior Center and generally kept the same schedule as De Anza College.  Joan Lomax retired in the fall of 1997.  Laura Green started directing the class in the fall of 1998. In the summer of 2004, De Anza College terminated the Older Adult Studies program because of funding priorities, and in the fall of 2004 the Choraliers was formed as an independent organization with ties to the Fun Times Singers.  The Fun Times Singers is another independent chorus that has several performances a year in the South Bay.



In the Choraliers, Laura continues to instruct and inspire approximately 40 seniors as they sing at retirement homes and care facilities throughout the year.  Laura skillfully directs and accompanies the group and continues to improve our musical skills. We are all richly rewarded by the response of the residents of the facilities where we sing.
